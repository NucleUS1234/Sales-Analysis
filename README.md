# Sales Data Analysis

This repository contains code for analyzing sales data and answering various questions related to sales performance. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific questions about sales trends and patterns.

## Overview

The main objective of this project is to analyze sales data and gain insights into sales performance. The analysis includes answering the following questions:

1. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
2. What city had the highest number of sales?
3. What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customers buying a product?
4. What products are most often sold together?
5. What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

## Data

The sales data used for this analysis is collected from multiple sources and merged into a single dataset. The dataset contains information such as sales amount, city, time of purchase, and products purchased.

## Analysis

The analysis is performed using Python programming language and various libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and numpy. The steps involved in the analysis include:

- Data cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to understand sales trends, distribution, and relationships between variables.
- Answering specific questions: Using the cleaned and analyzed data to answer the questions listed above.

## How to Use

To replicate the analysis:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script containing the analysis code.
4. Modify the code as needed for your specific dataset or analysis requirements.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into sales performance, including the best month for sales, top-selling products, optimal advertisement timing, and frequently sold product combinations. These insights can be used to make data-driven decisions and improve sales strategies.

## Future Work

Future work may include:

- Advanced analysis techniques such as predictive modeling to forecast sales.
- Incorporating external factors (e.g., economic indicators, seasonality) into the analysis for deeper insights.
- Building interactive dashboards or reports for stakeholders to visualize the sales data and insights.
